<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a project for a Software Engineering module, CS2103T in National University of Singapore. I am in a team of 4 Computer Science students and we were given the task of enhancing the existing Command Line Interface application that the module provided us with. We decided to morph the application into a Financial Tracker for Finance Secretaries in organisations. The name of the application is FinSec.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new application, allows for these Finance Secretaries to easily store their claims requests, income inflows and keep track of budget accurately. On top of these, the secretary can store the contacts of all the people who have made transactions with him so that it ensures easier tracking in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what our project looks like:</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section is a summary of my contributions to the project. I have 3 major enhancements and 1 minor enhancement in total. They are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 1</strong>: I added <strong>ability to <code>goto</code> a different view, through the different lists</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: this <code>goto</code> feature allows the user to get to the different lists, namely: contacts,
claims and incomes, changing the state at which the
user is currently at</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This feature is the backbone of my next 2 features because the changing of state is the underlying flag or checker
that ensures that these 3 features will work correctly in the 3 different lists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: This enhancement works well with the current UI design as I created 3 tabs to fit with the current
File and Help tabs. These tabs are added functions to allow the user to click to <code>goto</code> other lists if he/she wants to.
The tabs become an extra option for the user to do the same thing. The implementation was also challenging because AB3
only recognised 1 list and that was contacts list. Therefore I not only needed to ensure that the app runs with more than 1 list, but also to
ensure that this list is able to update to another list when the correct command is entered.
Also, after implementing the changing of lists, I had to also implement a state in each of these lists to make sure that the state
changes when a certain view is input as parameter into this <code>goto</code> feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 2</strong>: I added *ability to <code>sort</code> and <code>reverse</code> the 3 various lists.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>:The user is able to sort the lists according to name, date and status.
<code>reverse</code> on the other hand sorts the lists in the reverse order. This is where the states of the various lists will allow this sort feature to work
differently. An example will be in the state of claims. Only the <code>sort status</code> and <code>reverse status</code> will work as status belongs only to claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: The user can now sort the claims based on the most critical ones which are the pending claims. The <code>reverse</code>
feature also gives the user the flexibility to see the claims based on what he already approved. As for the <code>date</code> and <code>name</code>
parameters, they help the user filter through the specific date or name that he/she wants to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: This enhancement is extremely useful in comparison to the usual paper-filed version of claims or incomes
stored in a physical file for a Financial Secretary. The user can now search through the lists for his pending, approved or rejected
claims with much more ease now they are filed automatically with just 1 command. He can even find the oldest claim or income inflow
that he had with just another command. The implementation was also challenging because I had to come up with different comparators for the
different parameters as well as for <code>reverse</code> too which sorts the list in the reverse order of whatever parameter is typed. I had to consider
what was most important for the user. An example is that I chose to sort the claims list by the description of the claims when the user inputs
<code>sort name</code>. A Financial Secretary would be more likely to need the description of the claims when he wants to check through his claims.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement 3</strong>: I added <strong>the ability to <code>check</code> each individual claim or contact</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: in contacts page, the <code>check</code> feature allows the user to see the claims and details that are linked to the this current contact. In the
claims page, the check feature allows the user to view a single claim with the most important details on this
card. Both are shown through a pop-up to show the individual contact or claim. This feature once again makes use of the change of state in the goto
feature to ensure that the check works differently in both contacts or claims list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Once you have gone to the list of your choice and sorted it, this feature will retrieve the exact claim or contact
that is of interest to the user in a pop-up that cancels out all interference from the other items. The check in the contacts list will allow the
user to see the specific claims that are linked to this contact and see the details that tag along with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: This feature works extremely well with the above 2 features as well as for future implementations. Further implementations can include
directly going to the specific from the list of claims that pops up during the checking of contact in the contacts' list. Another implementation can be
the ability to pop up the claims that are of a certain date or status. If the sorting system in the feature is not enough for the user. This example of
<code>check November/2019</code> or <code>check Pending</code> in the claims list will give a user-friendly pop up of the filtered claims and display it clearly to the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement 1</strong>: I tweaked the <code>clear</code> feature in the existing AB3 to ensure that before the user is able to clear the list, the application prompts the
user one more time to ensure that the command was not by accident.</p>

<p>This section describes the ways that a user can sort the various lists. An overview is also included on how these sorts
work.
It also provides some design considerations to give users an insight of how the current solutions are worked out.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 2 ways that a user can sort the lists by. It gives the user flexibility in how he wants to see the lists. In
addition, after sorting, the user can then employ the check method once again to see each individual object.</p>

<p>The sort command takes in a 1 parameter that is the <code>Filter</code>. This <code>Filter</code> can either be <code>name</code> or <code>date</code>.
<code>name</code> filter works in all 3 lists. However, in contacts and incomes list, the <code>name</code> filter refers to the name of
the contact and in claims list, <code>name</code> refers to the description of the claim.
<code>date</code> filter works in claims and incomes list and not in contacts list because contacts are not created
with a date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1) The 2 parameters after the <code>sort</code> command in the user input are <code>name</code> and <code>date</code></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major implementation difference for claims list sorted by <code>name</code>, it is sorted based on the description of each
claim. This was implemented like this because of the check feature. The check feature in the contacts list allows
the user to see what claims are under the user. When a user is in the claims page, he/she will only need to sort based
on descriptions to prevent redundant information through different commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 2 different filters allow the user to be able to look through the lists based on what is important to him/her. <code>date</code>
filter is especially important so the user can check what are the latest or oldest claims. <code>name</code> filter helps the user
find the various contacts/claims/incomes. It doubles up as a find or filter function to let the user find the specific
object he/she is finding.</p>
