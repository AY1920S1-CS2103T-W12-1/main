== Introduction

FinSec is a Financial Planner that helps the finance secretaries of any department in National University of Singapore,
preferably from the School of Computing so that they would be more likely to like the idea of having a Command Line Interface (CLI) app.
The app focuses on the tracking of claims that will help the While FinSec has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), its main form of input is CLI based,

=== Creating a shortcut

Accidentally typed a command that is not in FinSec? Don't worry! FinSec will recognise that it is an unknown command and is smart enough to make that unknown entry into a shortcut!

Upon entering an unknown command, FinSec will prompt you as to whether you would like that as a new shortcut or if it was just a mistake.

*Choice 1 :* You can enter the keyword `n` to continue as per usual.

*Choice 2 :* You can enter any `existing commands` to map your previous entry to it!

If you have chosen *Choice 2*, you can use the newly created shortcut as a substitute to the command.

==== Example of *Choice 1* :

****
User : add_conagtact

FinSec: Create shortcut? To which command? If no, type "n"

User : n
****

Result:

No shortcut is created. Continue using FinSec as per normal!

<<UG-NoShortcutexample1>>, <<UG-NoShortcutExample2>> and <<UG-NoShortcutResult>> shows what you can expect to see after typing in the example: `add_conagtact`.

==== Example of *Choice 2* :

****
User : ai

FinSec: Create shortcut? To which command? If no, type "n"

User: add_income

FinSec: New shortcut created! ai to add_income
****

Result:

A new shortcut is created for you! From now on, `ai` can be used as a substitute for `add_income`!
