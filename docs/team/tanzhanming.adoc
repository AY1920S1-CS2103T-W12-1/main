= Tan Zhan Ming - Project Portfolio for FinSec
:site-section: AboutUs

== 1. Overview

=== 1.1 Introduction

This project portfolio serves to provide a sample of my technical software engineering skills, by showcasing the work I have done on FinSec - the financial secretary application.
FinSec was developed by a group of 4 students, including myself, as a software engineering project for the module CS2103T as part of our studies in the National University of Singapore.

=== 1.2 About the product

FinSec is a finance planning and management application that can keep track of various financial statistics such as claim amounts, revenue streams and overall budgets. 

The following image shows how FinSec's user interface looks like:

=== 1.3 Understanding this document

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

`budget`       		A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.
`**HelpWindow**`	Bold text with mark-up indicates a class/package name.

== 2. Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to FinSec.

=== 2.1 Features created

* *Major feature*: I added *the ability to calculate prospective budget values and generate a graph showing the claim, income and budget statistics for the current month*

** What it does: The `budget` command allows you to calculate your prospective budget - the balance of money you are expected to have after all your expenses from the approved claims have been subtracted from your income stream.
FinSec will also warn you if you are over budget, which would result in a negative balance.
Besides calculating the overall budget, the `budget` command also displays claim, income and budget statistics for the current month via a graphical representation.
This money-over-time graph uses 3 distinct colours to represent claim, income and budget values, coupled with tooltips to clearly show you the progression of said values over the course of the month.

** Justification: The main point of a finance management application like FinSec is to keep track of the cashflow in your organisation. The `budget` command does exactly that by calculating the difference in all the approved claim and income values and showing you your overall budget.
By providing a clear graphical representation at the same time, it allows you to easily identify certain problems that might arise in the current month - such as the need to raise finance or cash flow difficulties.

** Highlights: This graphical portion of the `budget` command is incredibly visual in nature and thus makes it very easy for you to identify an entire month's worth of data in a short span of time.
This is done by varying the data-point shape, colour and width of the lines used to plot the claim, income and budget values. I have also implemented tooltips on each data-point to display the respective value amount and day number.
The implementation was quite challenging as the library I used for the graphing was not a native one. Thus, I had to research extensively on what the limits of said library was and how to use it as a base to build
my ideal implementation. For example, I had to create my own custom tooltips to incorporate into the graph as the default ones provided did not provide as much clarity to the user as I had wanted.

** Credits: I would like to thank JFreeChart [http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/] for their amazing open source library. I had a much easier time utilising their API to create a graph rather than trying to do so with javafx.











=== 2.2 Enhancements made

* *Major enhancement*: I updated the existing `help` command to provide 3 types of help for each command.

** What it does: 

** Justification: 

** Highlights: Type API generates the html file onto the user's system and replaces it to prevent excess file cluttering.

=== 2.4 Other contributions

* Project management
** I have managed product releases `v1.3` and `v1.3.2` on https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-1/main/releases[GitHub].

* Enhancements to existing features
** Updated the original `**HelpWindow**` to display the command list and to take the user to the FinSec userguide directly instead of simply providing them with a link. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-1/main/pull/78[#78])

* Documentation:
** Contributed multiple diagrams in the user guide and developer guide of FinSec to explain the execution and implementation of the `budget` and `help` commands.
