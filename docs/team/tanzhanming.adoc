_{Start of extract for `help` command}_

=== Viewing help : `help`

Provides 3 different types of help for all commands in FinSec.

Keyword: `help`

Format:
`help cmd/COMMAND type/TYPE`

Refer to <<Command Summary>> for all available commands

Types include: +
`brief` (gives a brief description) +
`guide` (opens a web browser and bring you to our user guide) +
`api` (for advanced users who want to know the inner workings of the command)

Cant remember all of FinSec's commands or the command format for `help`? No worries! Even if you mistakenly
type `help` without the other parameters or get the parameters confused, a default help window such as the one below
will appear and display a command list with similar instructions to this page!

Instead of typing in `help`, you can also access help by clicking on the `help` button +
on the top left of the FinSec application GUI or just press kbd:[F1] on your keyboard +
as shown below!

Example commands: +
....
help cmd/add_contact type/brief
....
This shows you a brief description of what the `add_contact` command does and how to use it
....
help cmd/goto type/api
....
This generates an 'API.html' file containing our API for the `goto` command, and opens it up
....
help cmd/help type/guide
....
This opens up a page in your browser and brings you right here to this section!

<<UG-HelpExample>> shows what you can expect to see when typing in the first example: `help cmd/add_contact type/brief`.

_{Start of extract for `budget` command}_

=== Budget feature

The `budget` command allows for users to Generate a `**Budget**` object in FinSec. It also creates a `**Budget Graph**`
object and displays it via the User Interface.

==== Overview
The `**Budget**` feature relies primarily on the `**Claim**` and `**Income**` features, and serves as an extension to
calculate their difference.
The `**Budget**` object calculates the cash amount values of all existing `**Income**` objects and all cash amount
values of `**Claims**` that have a status of 'approved'.
It then returns the difference in values as the budget value and creates a graph detailing the statistics for the month.

==== Current Implementation
<<budgetSeqDiagram>> is a sequence of steps that illustrates the interaction between various classes when the `budget`
command is entered.

.Execution sequence of the `budget` command
image::BudgetSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 1 :* The `budget` command is passed on to the `**LogicManager**` as commandText +

*Step 2 :* The `**LogicManager::execute**` method then calls `**FinSecParser::parseCommand**` which receives the user
input (`budget`) as a parameter. +

*Step 3 :* FinSecParser then references the various command words and identifies the command to be a `budget` command
. It then calls the `**BudgetCommand**` class.

*Step 4 :* This newly created `**BudgetCommand**` object is returned to the LogicManager class, which then calls the
`**BudgetCommand::execute**` method.

*Step 5 :* The `**BudgetCommand**` then interacts with the model component of our software architecture to create a
filteredList of all `**Income**` and `**Claim**` objects using the `**model.getFilteredClaimList()**` and `**model
.getFilteredIncomeList()**` methods.

*Step 6 :* It instantiates a `**Budget**` object which contains methods such as `**calculateTotalExpenses()**` and
`**calculateBudget()**` to calculate the amount values of all the `**Claims**`, `**Incomes**` and thus use them to find
the budget amount. +
A `**BudgetGraph**` object is also created in parallel (Details expanded upon below)

*Step 7:* The `**BudgetCommand::execute**` finally completes by constructing a message string containing all these
values and returning a new `**CommandResult**` with the specific message string to its calling method which is
`**LogicManager::execute**`.

*Step 8 :* `**LogicManager::execute**` method returns a `**CommandResult**` to the calling method which is
`**MainWindow::executeCommand**`

*Step 9 :* The specific feedback is then retrieved through `**CommandResult::getFeedbackToUser**` and set in the result
display of the MainWindow. +

While creating the `**Budget**` object, a `**BudgetGraph**` object is also created in parallel. The activity diagram
below
shows how it would look like from a user's point of view.

<<budgetActDiagram>> describes the workflow of FinSec when the `budget` command is entered.

The series of steps below demonstrates what the `**BudgetGraph**` object does in parallel to Step 6 above.

*Step 6a :* At the same time the `**Budget**` object is created, the `**BudgetGraph**` object is also instantiated,
which is
basically an XY-graph.

*Step 6b :* The `**BudgetGraph**` object creates a dataset by taking in the list of `**Claims**` and `**Incomes**` and
parsing
them to the `**ClaimPlotter**`, `**IncomePlotter**` and `**BudgetPlotter**` classes.

*Step 6c :* The 3 plotter classes then filter their respective lists to create new lists for the current month and start adding the points to the series.

The code snippet below shows the `**ClaimPlotter::plotClaims**` method +

[source, java]

   XYSeries plotClaims() {
        Double amountToAdd;
        findClaimValueAtStartOfMonth();
        claimSeries.add(1, startingExpenses);
        double currentExpenses = startingExpenses;
        List<Claim> approvedClaimsInCurrentMonthList = findApprovedClaimsInCurrentMonth();
        for (int day = 2; day <= 30; day++) {
            for (Claim claim : approvedClaimsInCurrentMonthList) {
                if (claim.getDate().date.getDayOfMonth() == day) {
                    amountToAdd = Double.parseDouble(claim.getAmount().value);
                    assert amountToAdd >= 0 : "A negative claim value managed to get into the claim list";
                    currentExpenses += amountToAdd;
                    currentExpenses = Math.round(currentExpenses * 100) / 100.0;
                }
            }
            claimSeries.add(day, currentExpenses);
        }
        return claimSeries;
    }

*Step 6d :* Once the 3 series have been returned, the plotter classes then return the completed dataset to the
`**BudgetGraph**` class which then renders the image.

*Step 6e :* The `**BudgetCommand::execute**` method then calls the `**BudgetGraph::displayBudgetGraph**` method to
display the graph image.



==== Why was it implemented this way?
With so many claims and incomes, all having differing dates, it can be hard to keep track of how much money one should have on hand at any one time.

* We felt that while knowing how much our prospective budget would be is good, knowing it over a range of time
(such as a month in the case of `**BudgetGraph**`) would help with better planning

* We also wanted to keep track of the history of said `**Claims**` and `**Incomes**` and doing it over a 1 month period
ensures there will not be too visual data cluttering the screen.

==== Design Considerations

We have considered between two differing graph designs.

.Graph Designs
[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
| Graph Design Considerations 			|	Pros and Cons
| Single Graph (Current Choice)  		|	*Pros* : Clean and clutter-free display.

                                        	 	*Cons* : It does not display as much data

| Separate Graphs based on Organisation Tags    |	*Pros* : Displays all relevant data that the user can possibly ask for

							*Cons* : Opening a multitude of graphs will visually clutter the screen with data
							unless more parsing is done to sort out which graphs are required
|=======================
We have settled on adopting a single-graph approach as having multiple graphs open can lead to the user being
overwhelmed by unnecessary data, and the code needed to achieve this result satisfactorily would be too convoluted.
